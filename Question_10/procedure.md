Implementation Order and Testing

1. Add a Person
Functionality:
- Implement `addContact()` to add a contact to the list.

Testing:
- Add contacts to the list, ensuring it handles up to 12 contacts.

2. Delete a Person
Functionality:
- Implement `deleteContact()` to remove a contact by index.

Testing:
- Add contacts, then delete some by index and verify removal.

3. Update a Person
Functionality:
- Implement `updateContact()` to modify an existing contact's information.

Testing:
- Add contacts, update some of their details, and verify changes.

4. Display All Contacts
Functionality:
- Implement `viewContacts()` to display all contacts.

Testing:
- Add, delete, and update contacts, then display to verify the list reflects all changes.

Testing Process

1. Initialization
   - Confirm the contact list initializes correctly.

2. Adding Contacts
   - Test adding contacts without exceeding the 12-contact limit.

3. Deleting Contacts
   - Add several contacts, delete some by index, and display to ensure removal.

4. Updating Contacts
   - Modify existing contacts and verify the updates are correct.

5. Displaying Contacts
   - After adding, updating, and deleting contacts, display the list to confirm all changes are accurately reflected.

This structured approach ensures each functionality is implemented and tested methodically.
