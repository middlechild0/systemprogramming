/*inorrect version of the code / / This code has a compile-time error, and at ** least one run-time error. */ #include <stdio.h> #include <math.h> main(int argc,char *argv[]) { int n,i; int d2,count, double d1; while (1) { printf("Enter a number (0 to quit): "); scanf("%d",&n); if (n == 0) break; count=0; for (i=0; i<n; i++) { d1=(double)n/(double)i; d2=n/i; if (fabs(d1-(double)d2) < 0.00001) count++; } if (count == 2) printf("%d is prime\n",n); else printf("%d is not prime\n",n); } }

At which line of code does the program crash?line 20 and line 27 line 20: for (i=0; i<n; i++) line 27: if (count == 2) Why does it crash there?i has been initialized with a 0 hence division by 0 brings a runtime error.To avoid this, use for (i=1; i<n; i++) count has been assigned to 2 which makes it difficult to identify if a number is a prime number.Since a prime number is divisible by 1 and itself,count===1 so that the condition satisfies if it is a prime number
